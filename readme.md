## ðŸ”¬ My primary research areas include:

### 1. Advancing Large Language Models through Transfer Learning and Task-Specific Adaptability

This research introduces a novel architectural framework for large language models (LLMs) designed to enhance efficiency, reduce biases, and facilitate task-specific adaptability. The framework comprises two integral components: the Autopilot System and the Mental Process, supported by a dynamic self-taking mechanism. Leveraging transfer learning, this comprehensive design aims to create not only data-efficient but also adaptable and nuanced language models.

### 2. Layered Filtering Approach for Discovering Optimal Transformers Architectures

In this research, titled "Layered Filtering Approach for Discovering Optimal Transformers Architectures," we propose a novel strategy for effectively searching for optimal transformer architectures. The approach involves systematically filtering the search space through a series of layers, each refining the set of architectures to identify the most promising candidates. By progressively narrowing down the options, our goal is to efficiently discover architectures that exhibit superior performance.

## Python Package - `AdvancedAccelerator`

I've developed the `AdvancedAccelerator` (https://github.com/elgrhy/advancedneural) Python package, a tool tailored to enhance the efficiency and performance of transformer-based models.

### Key Features:

- **Dropout**: Mitigating overfitting and improving generalization.
- **Residual Connections**: Facilitating the flow of information through deep networks.
- **Layer-wise Normalization:** Improving training stability and convergence.
